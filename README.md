# SSMA (Simple Social Media App)
It says it on the tin! This is a social media app with a complete backend powered by PocketBase.

Nothing will really come from this little project other than me demonstrating my skills. I am just a small developer afterall!

Documentation MIGHT come, but for now it's just gonna be this README for now.

If you're wondering, no, this won't come with PocketBase installed. But I will include a way to reconstuct the collections and API rules.
